<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/), supervised by [Dr. Yi Ding](https://ding1.com/) in the [Assistive Intelligence Lab](https://ding1.com/lab/). My research interests include Machine Learning and Computer Vision, and my current work focuses on 3D Computer Vision, Gaussian Splatting, and neural scene representations.
