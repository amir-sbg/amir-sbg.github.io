# 🌍 Experiences and Reflections
Here I share my academic journey, conferences I attended, lessons learned, and personal reflections as a PhD student in Computer Science.

---

## 🎤 Conference Experiences
- *2025.05*: Attended **ICCV 2025** — learned about 3D Vision, Gaussian Splatting, and diffusion-based reconstruction.
- *2024.12*: Participated in **Georgia AI Symposium** — presented poster on driver behavior analysis.

---

## 🧠 Things I’ve Learned
- Gaussian Splatting is insanely fast but depends heavily on camera calibration.
- Research is not linear — it is 90% debugging, 10% breakthroughs.
- Talking to researchers grows your knowledge 10× faster than reading alone.
